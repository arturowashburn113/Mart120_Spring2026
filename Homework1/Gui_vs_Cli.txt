GUI and CLI are terms that refer to types of computer interfaces. GUI stands for graphical user interface while CLI stands for command-line interface. GUI refers to the common functionalities of our computer screen. Icons representing different files or launchers, buttons on our screen, etc. CLI on the other hand refers to the raw mechanics that can be seen on a computer's terminal. CLI is very precise and exact to what you want your computer to do, but GUI was created due to the complexity of operating a computer at that level. Overall it's very handy to understand how to operate a computer though CLI, but it is often very acceptable to navigate through GUI as well.
